    Ok, so your algorithm found some lines. Before moving on, you should check that the detection makes sense. To confirm that your detected lane lines are real, you might consider:

    Checking that they have similar curvature
    Checking that they are separated by approximately the right distance horizontally
    Checking that they are roughly parallel
